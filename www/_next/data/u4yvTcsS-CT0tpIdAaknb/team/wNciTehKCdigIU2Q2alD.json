This is specifically true for elections of national scale where elections can be altered. The ability to share, express and get your opinion a proper feedback is a right that many don't have. And that is the goal we are aiming at. ChaingeVote provides a clear way to express your vote using Blockchain. A Peer-to-peer network connecting stations which are used to vote. These votes are stored on blocks that are chained together. After filling a block, it gets broadcasted to the near stations which get the block and put it in their chains.","projectLinks":"https://github.com/boki1/HackTUES-6","semiFinalistsLeft":true,"scoreSemiFinal":31,"special":false,"finalist":false,"scoreFinal":0}},"__N_SSG":true}
